xmonobut readme

Xmonobut is a simple X11 application that helps access 2nd and 3rd
mouse buttons on touchscreen / single mouse button ( such as macs ) machines.

The 'missing' buttons are made accessable by breifly modifying the
mouses button map. This can be done by clicking on the xmonobut window
to 'rotate' the mouse buttons or xmonobut can be bound to a key, so
that holding this key and clicking will produce an alternate button click.


Usage: 

xmonobut [options...] 

where options are;

        -d <display> Xserver to connect to.

        -k <keycode> keycode to grab. Tap once for right mouse button
                     , quickly tap twice for middle button ( disabled
                     if middle button keycode selected ).

        -t <value>   Time in milliseconds to catch double clicks
                     Defauts to 200.

        -m <keycode> Keycode to grab for middle mouse button.

        -n           Do not display dock window.

        -c           Do not change cursor.

        -r           Align window right in dock ( matchbox only )


Bugs:

If xmonobut is bound to a key, releasing the mouse button before the
bound key may cause unpredictable results.
